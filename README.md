# Introduction to R for advanced Stata users

## Background
This material was developed by the [DIME Analytics](https://worldbank.github.io/dimeanalytics/) team as an introduction to R Statistical Package for its staff. It builds upon knowledge of Stata to explore features of R with impact evaluation applications in mind. It also assumes some degree of familiarity with DIME's [coding practices](https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/wiki/Stata_Coding_Practices).

## Version
The master branch version was adopted in DIME's R Couse in November/December 2018.

1. Intro to R: introduction to RStudio, R syntax, objects and classes.
