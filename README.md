# R training for NISR

This is the material for the NISR training delivered in Kigali in August 2018. It includes PDFs and markdown files for the presentations, the codes used as a basis for exercises, and the final solutions. The data sets used can be found in [this link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/9rjn9t50r4v74vb/AACoeSoIX0cgWtIfo15zO_bQa?dl=0).

Compared to the original training, this version has
1. A longer Lab 2.
2. A slightly more concise Labs 4 and 5.
3. No integration with latex.
4. Only part of the material covered in Lab 6.
